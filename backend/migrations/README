# Tic Tac Toe Flask React
## How the game was created:
* Created 2 seperate files (backend and frontend)
* in the back end there is a virtual environment as well as a requirements file
### Building the database in the backend:
* logged into pgAdmin and created the database.
* created a .env for the database url
* added to the requirements : alembic, python-dotenv, flask-cors, flask-Migrate, flask-SQLAlchemy, 
* models.py - contains the set up for the tables in the database.
* main.py - contains the location of the database and set up for db and migrations.
* app.py - containes the routes. 
* ran: alimbic init migrations - this created the migrations and versions direcotry, env.py, script.py.mako
* ran: flask db migrate
* ran flask --app app run --debug
